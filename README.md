# End-to-End Web Application Development in Power BI Using CoinGecko API

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a web application in Power BI using data from the CoinGecko API. The goal is to provide a dynamic and interactive cryptocurrency dashboard that replicates some of the functionality seen on the CoinGecko website.

### Key Features:

- **Data Extraction & Transformation**: Connects to the free CoinGecko API to pull real cryptocurrency data, including price, market cap, volume, and other key metrics. Using Power Query in Power BI, we clean, transform, and structure the data for analysis. This project also deals with **looping through API calls using recursive functions** and **handling rate limits** imposed by the API provider to ensure reliable data extraction.
- **Visualizations**: The dashboard uses **only native Power BI visuals**, leveraging Power BIâ€™s built-in capabilities to create intuitive, user-friendly charts and tables for real-time insights into cryptocurrency data.

This project serves as a practical example of how to build a data-driven web application entirely within Power BI, integrating real data while maintaining efficient data handling techniques.
